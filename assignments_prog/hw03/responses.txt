### Questions

4. Mean of Euclidean Distance between categories:
    Data:
        - WITHIN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN = 1.065550e+06
        - BETWEEN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN = 1.172625e+06
            * Between-Category Distance mean is LARGER
    
    Analysis:
        - In this context --> a LARGER mean signifies that the images had more *dissimilar* responses to our set of filters.
        - That is, when the mean is larger, then images are LESS alike, according to our filter responses.
        - Here, we can see that the mean **between-categories** is GREATER than the mean **within-categories**.
        - This is indeed what I would expect, because within-category images SHOULD have *more similar* responses to our filters, overall.
        
        
7. Mean Across All 48 filters Individually
    Data:
        - WITHIN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN  = 4.992002e+00
        - BETWEEN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN = 1.156995e+01
            * Again, Between-Category Distance mean is LARGER
            
    Analysis:
        - Comparison --> Here, the total values are MUCH smaller, but we have same result: Between-Category means are still LARGER
        - Expectations --> This is in line with what I would expect, personally. I don't see why taking the aggregate means (as in Q6) would necessarily
        yield a different result than evaluating each mean **individually** (as in Q7). However, I did expect that the **between-category** means would
        be LARGER than the **within-category** means, overall.
            * So: this is not MORE in line with what I would expect, it is just what I would expect, overall, in BOTH instances.

8. Mean Across Pixel Representations
    Data:
        - WITHIN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN = 3.671682e+04
        - BETWEEN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN = 4.316043e+04

    Analysis:
        - Again, *between-category* distances are larger than *within* category distances, as expected. 


9.   Which of the three types of descriptors that you used is the best one?
        - Of the three descriptors, I think that the **technique used in #7** --> comparing the means of each filter's response individually is the best.
        
     How can you tell? Include your reasoning in your response.
        - I can tell this because the result is in-line with both: my own expectations, AND it confirms the results found in each of the other tests, but with greater sensitivity.
        Specifically, it confirms that the *between-category* vectors are MORE DIFFERENT, on average, than **within-category** vectors.
        - Moreover, it confirms these results with a difference between the categories that is a __full_order_of_magnitude__ in size.
        - Again, for #7, here's our data:
            * WITHIN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN  = 4.992002e+00
            * BETWEEN-CATEGORY DISTANCE MEAN = 1.156995e+01
                --> As we can see, the expected result is confirmed, but with a MUCH higher difference in magnitude between the resulting averages.
        - Beyond that, I think this test is beneficial by taking the average of MORE data points total than #6.  (There are 48 different filters in #7, each
        analyzed individually).
            * AND the those data points are MORE MEANINGFUL than the representation used in #8 (total pixel values, which in and of themselves may be misleading, 
            and would only really be similar if we had images of the same animal at the same level of detail.)
