Question:  How and why does the SSD differ based on the values of K?
    For different values of k, we converge upon a different number of clusters. And the number of clusters that we select are equal to the number of different values
    that the resulting quantized image can have in each of its pixel cells.
    
    For instance, if k=2, all of the pixels in our **quantized image** must have a value in the range [0,1].

    Likewise, if k=5, then all of the pixels in our **quantized image** must have a values in the range [0, 4]

    However, we know that the range of possible values for the **original image** will ALWAYS be [0, 255].

    So, when we compute the SSD using different values of K, we will __necessarily__ be computing sets of numbers in different ranges (i.e. - [0,k])
    against values in the range [0,255].

    And because the ranges of possible values must change, according to k--which dictates which values are possible--we will necessarily have different
    results when we compute the SSD for different values of k.
