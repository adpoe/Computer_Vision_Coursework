## Instructions - Color Quantize
- To run the Color Quantization section of the project, run the script named: "colorQuantizeMain.m"
    * Please CHANGE:  the image path on LINE 14. It is coded to be the path necessary on my workspace.

## Instructions - Edge & Circle Detection
- To run the Edge & Cricle Detection algorithms, run the script named: "findCircleMain.m"
    * please CHANGE: the image paths on LINES 13 and 15. Again, these paths are coded for my workspace.
