## Overall Notes
- The Code I've written for this assignment can be found in the folder named "__CODE"
- My written responses can be found in the folder named "written responses"
- Provided code from the prompt is in the folder named 'provided code'
- In PART I --> I used the **SMALL** SIFT subset, not the full one. So my results will reflect that.

### Bag of Words
- For the Bag of Words part of the assignment, you can demo selecting an area and finding its top 3 matches by running the file named 'regionQueries.m'
- I have this script set up so that it **always** reads in the same file, number 100 in the fnames directory.
    * To change this setting for any reason, alter the i=100 assignment on line 32
- I do NOT have this script setup to run 5x. I'm not sure if that was an expectation, but it wasn't explicit, so I am mentioning that here in this README to avoid any potential confusion.
- I ran this script 5x and collected the outputs from each run, took screenshots, and placed those results in the folder named "queries"
- Please see the "queries" folder to see my outputs from each run of the algorithm

## Homographies
- For the homographies script, "homography script.m", all 4 of the selected points will display a figure showing the 'before' and 'after' states from the homography computation, as outlined in the assignment prompt.
