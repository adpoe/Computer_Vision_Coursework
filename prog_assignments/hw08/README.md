## Overall Notes
- For this assignment, our goal was to classify a test set of animal images using two methods: 1) Zero-Shot Classification. And 2) Support Vector Machines.
- Both classification algorithms are implemented.
* Zero Shot is in --> "zero_shot.m"
* SVM is in --> "svm.m"
- I did NOT include the supporting data files, since they were very large for this project, but these files are DEPENDENCIES, and they can be downloaded at: http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/cs1699/files/Animals_with_Attributes/

## Graded Files
- The three files which the assignment prompt specifically notes will be graded are:
1. **zero_shot.m** - In this file, you will find my zero-shot implementation, along with comments outlining my thinking process
2. **svm.m** - This file contains my SVM implementation
3. **results.txt** - This file contains the results of my testing

## Notes and Instructions
**LINES TO CHANGE:**  
* zero_shot.m --> LINE 16, this performs a lot of the "zero_shot_setup.mat" file. Please change this to be consistent with your path to that file
* svm.m --> LINE 18, again: this performs a lot of the "zero_shot_setup.mat" file. Please change this to be consistent with your path to that file
